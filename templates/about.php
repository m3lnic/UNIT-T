            <h1>212th Falcon Company</h1>
            <p>The 212th Falcon Company is a unit based upon the 212th seen in the Clone Wars TV show or the movies. We are a semi-serious community, we give you the seriousness during the operations while not the overboard, yes sir, or drill sergeant BCT courses that some units force. Instead, we offer structure and a short BCT that is adaptable to the player rather than set in stone. Missions are very varied, with members of the unit choosing when to Zeus rather than have one person do it set in stone, examples are; Delivering supplies, Civilian rescue, insurgency removal, town defences, the liberation of towns, airfield takeover, trench warfare and much more! Our enemies vary from droids to rebel forces, to insurrectionists or even planetary defence forces. We are a rapidly growing unit, with over 45 members enlisted, and we donâ€™t plan on stopping any time soon.</p>
